![Cat and Dog](dotnet-api-demo/docs/images/catdog.jpg)

## 🚀 Introduction

This repository contains the code for the Cats & Dogs API, a .NET 8 Web API that provides information about cats and dogs. The API demonstrates how to create a web API using .NET, including setting up routes, handling requests, and returning responses. It's a great starting point for learning or building more complex APIs.

## 📚 Documentation

The documentation for the API can be found [here](docs/index.md). It covers the available endpoints, request and response formats, and examples. The documentation is generated using [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/).

## 🛠️ Development

To run the API locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
2. Navigate to the root of the repository and run:

```bash
dotnet run
````

The API will be available at `https://localhost:5000`.
