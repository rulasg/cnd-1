# 🐱🐶 Cats & Dogs API Documentation

## 🚀 Introduction

This repository contains the code for the Cats & Dogs API, a .NET 8 Web API that provides information about cats and dogs. The API demonstrates how to create a web API using .NET, including setting up routes, handling requests, and returning responses. It's a great starting point for learning or building more complex APIs.

## 🛠️ Development

To run the API locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
2. Navigate to the root of the repository and run:

```shell
dotnet run
````

The API will be available at `https://localhost:5001`.
